    <h4>My Childhood</h4>
    <p>
      I have been painting for as long as I can remember. I used to sit on the
      floor for several hours and paint. One day,getting up from the ground, <br>
      I heard a strange sound. It seemed to be coming from somewhere on my upper
      thigh and continued as I walked. My parents took me from doctor to doctor; <br>
      who told them I was only seeking attention. My mother however believed me.
      She took me to the best orthopedic surgeon in Iran. The doctor explained <br>
      that the head of both my femurs were not completely settled inside the acetabulum cavity.
      With every step that I took, my femurs came out and went back in the cavity, <br>
      which is what made the sound. I also had medial rotation in both legs, and
      my walking was slightly abnormal. According to the doctor, this was caused <br>
      by the <a href="wsit.jpeg">W-sitting</a> position I used while painting. He said I needed surgery
      on both my legs. After the surgery I was in a cast from the waist down, <br>
      motionless, for 65 days. When they removed the cast, I realized that my lower
      body was completely frozen - I could not even sit down on a chair. It was <br>
      horrifying for an eight-year-old. After two months of rehabilitation,
      I could slowly walk using a walker, but it took me a long time to walk normally.<br>
      The next year I had another surgery to take out the implants that were
      fixing my hip joints.
      <br>
      <p>That was a critical time in my life. I wanted to know exactly what was the problem that restricted my life for such a long time.
      Once I got better, my mother took me to a book store as she used to do before.
      This time, instead of childish story books, I chose biology books for children.
      Gradually, I kept learning about human anatomy and how orthosis and protesis could fix, replace, or help normal posture and movement.
      I got used to reading science books.
      After elementary school, I was among the 1% across the country who were
      accepted to the National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NOET).
      There I was an active student who was always one of the participants in all competitions
      and the extracurricular activities. I won the National Kharazmi Award at 13 years old for
      estimating body dimensions from footprints.
      after a year, I conditioned a rabbit for which I won the best experimental
      project award from my school. I was accepted in the first phase of mathematics and the first phase of physics
      Olympiads when I was a high school student.</p>
      <p>I was in the top 1% among the 500,000 participants in the university entrance exam
        and because of my interest in health related studies, I decided that Biomedical Engineeringwould be
        the best match with my interests. I started to work as a Physics and Chemistry tutor in addition to my studies
        and later I found a job in a medical instrument import company.
        After a few months working there, one of my professors offered me a job in his company which, was a medical
        orthopedic orthosis development firm.
        During my undergrad, I took diverse, and sometimes unrelated courses, to expand my knowledge
        and to find which topics appeals to me the most.
        I wanted to familiarize myself with as many as possible domains of biomedical engineering
        and then pick one of them as my research area to dive deeper into.
        I passed artificial intelligence, signals and systems, advanced computer programming, and
        advance statistics in addition to the program curriculum.
        My work experiences made me more interested in and familiar with biomechanical studies.
      </p>
        <p>I decided to pursue a master of biomechanical engineering, but first I had to compete with 200,000
        participants whose B.Sc. majors were already in mechanical or biomechanical engineering.
        Only 200 would be accepted into one of few universities across the country that offered biomechanics.
        I knew that it would not be an easy challenge, especially as I had never taken any mechanical Engineering courses,
        but on the other hand, I never give up on my goals. I had no choice but to
        educate myself reading diverse mechanical engineering books and references.
        After 11 months of hard work I finally took the graduate entrance exam.
        Unbelievably, I ranked 75 out of 200,000 participants. It was one of my greatest
        achievements, and for another time it made me believe by hearth that if I really decide to do something,
        I will definitely succeed. It just took courage and hard work. I got to continue my studies on University of Tehran,
        one of the most prestigious universities in the Middle East.
        I also won a national scholarship because of my top ranking.</p>
        <p>In the first semester I was a research assistant in biomechanics lab where
          I worked on movement analysis, motion capture, and performance monitoring
          by force plates and electromyography.
          I learned how to work with OpenSim software. So, I found this field of biomechanics really
          interesting and was about to pick a thesis topic in this area, but then I encountered an article
          about Biodegradable Implants. Before then I did not know about implants that dissolve
          inside the body after doing their job to fix a fracture or abnormality.
          I could still remember how much I suffered from my second surgery to extract
          the implants from my legs. I was determined to do something to prevent others
          from going through that miserable surgery. After reading more articles
          I detected a gap in that field. I decided to work on developing biodegradable implants for my master thesis
          before going back to the area that was appealing to me.</p>
, for instance, working with cadaver is prohibited and only medical students have limited access to biological tissues.
 I am interested in how technology can increase the patientsâ€™ quality of life,
 by improving assessment, monitoring, and support of mobility. However, our instruments are old and access to
 instruments are now restricted to Iranians. There are some other restrictions in Iran; in Islamic law
These restrictions, as well as the lack of substantial research teams in my field in Iran, caused me to look abroad to continue my studies and research. I investigated research groups and faculty members in different universities and found that my research interests and academic backgrounds are correlated with Dr. Blinch.
I would be honored to continue my education at the Department of Kinesiology and Sport Management at Texas Tech University. I believe the Kinesiology faculty will shed light on my long path to knowledge. It is my honor to be considered for your program, and I hope I will be able to contribute to the field of motor control and produce valuable results for the future of science.
